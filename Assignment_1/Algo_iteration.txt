//Algorithm for "Fibonacci series" using Iteration


STEP 1  	START
STEP 2		Declare the value of n1=5, n2=500, a=0, b=1 and i=2
STEP 3		Print a and b
STEP 4		Repeat until i<=n
STEP 5	 	  sum=a+b
STEP 6	 	  print sum
STEP 7	 	  a=b
STEP 8	          b=sum
STEP 9	       STOP

OBSERVATIONS:
		Time complexity:O(n)
		Space complexity:O(1)

This is "BEST CASE" when compared to "Recursive Method" as 

*)Time complexity is  minimum.
*)Space complexity is constant as we rewrite the variables.
